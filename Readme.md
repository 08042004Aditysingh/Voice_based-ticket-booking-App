2) The user will answer the queries and based on this he will get hotel suggestions(on other channel also like email/whatsapp).
3) The user will select a hotel and further enter his contact details like phone number, email address, etc.
4) The user will receive a payment link on his email address. (You may provide a dummy link of upi payment)
5) After successful payment he will be informed about the booking status whether it is booked or failed.
